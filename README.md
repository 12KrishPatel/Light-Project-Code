This project was completed as part of Bartlett High School's STEM Magnet Academy. I was tasked with creating a project that showcased the skills I had acquired throughout the courses I took in high school. I chose this project because it allowed me to explore a programming language with which I had minimal prior experience, while also piquing the interest of potential customers.

I presented this product in front of an audience, which included parents of other students and professionals exploring the showcase. This project taught me a great deal about programming and data storage. Halfway through, we had to store the data in the program memory rather than the Arduino memory. Learning how to accomplish this required me to delve into a side of computer science that I had not encountered until then.

One of my future goals is to develop a website/application that empowers users to choose and display various designs. While I made an initial attempt in the past, I realized the need for a deeper understanding. I aspire to create this platform using JavaScript and ReactJS, organizing designs systematically into categories. The objective is to provide users with an intuitive catalog, facilitating a seamless selection process.
